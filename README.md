# Recommendation for Shoppers Using Black Friday Data
## Purpose of the Model
This model uses Kaggle's Black Friday dataset. The original dataset was located at https://www.kaggle.com/mehdidag/black-friday

The purpose of this model is to recommend products for each user ID.

## Data Exploration and Data Analysis
The data analysis and data visualization is done in the Jupyter Notebook bf_exploratory_analysis.ipynb. https://github.com/v-loves-avocados/black-friday/blob/master/bf_exploratory_analysis.ipynb

# Modeling
## Input
In the input data, each row is one transaction including the following columns:
  - User ID
  - Product ID
  - Expense
  
## Collaborative Filtering

Collaborative filtering is a popular method to build recommendation systems. It predicts the feedback for new items based on large-scale existing user-item feedback. The gif from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering explains the idea.
